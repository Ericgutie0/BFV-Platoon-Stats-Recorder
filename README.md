# BFV-Platoon-Stats-Tracker
Records a Platoons (gaming clan) roster overall stats from the game Battlefield V (BFV)

There isn't any program at the moment the calculates a group of friends stats (Platoon) for the game Battlefield V on the internet. There also isn't an open API avalible for the game. 
So, the work around I figured for stat calculation (instead of building an API) is to web scrap the data from
a site that already calculates a single player's BFV stats. That site is https://battlefieldtracker.com/ 

The work has been done, all that is required from the user is a txt file with the gamertags formatted like the one's in 'TSC.txt' (my platoon, im Wonderbread200) and run it in the 'platoon_put_in' function. The end product is the group of friends stats like , Kill/Death Ratio, Total Kills, Average Kills, Total Revives, etc. stored in a txt file called 'Stats' like the
one in the repo.

This program works for Battlefield V players on all platforms but,as of now, EVERY member must be on the SAME gaming plaform.
More about the program in the code.
